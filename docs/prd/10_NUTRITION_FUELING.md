# PRD: Nutrition & Fueling Strategy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the nutrition and fueling strategies integrated into the RunningCoach application. Evidence-based nutrition is a controllable variable that significantly impacts training adaptation, recovery, and race performance.

## 2. Research Foundation
*   **Carbohydrate Requirements:** Vary by training volume (5-12 g/kg/day).
*   **Protein Needs:** 1.2-2.0 g/kg/day, with timing (every 3-5 hours) being critical for muscle protein synthesis.
*   **Fat Intake:** Should never fall below 20% of total energy to support hormonal health.
*   **Race Fueling:** 60-90g/hour using dual-source carbohydrates (glucose:fructose) improves performance for events >2.5 hours.
*   **Carb Loading:** Modern protocols (10-12 g/kg for 36-48 hours) increase glycogen stores by nearly double without depletion phases.

## 3. Daily Nutrition Guidelines

### 3.1. Training Phase Targets
Dynamic macro targets based on daily training volume:

*   **Rest/Easy Day (1 hour):**
    *   Carbs: 5-7 g/kg
    *   Protein: 1.2-1.4 g/kg
    *   Fat: Balance (min 20%)
*   **Moderate Day (1-3 hours):**
    *   Carbs: 6-10 g/kg
    *   Protein: 1.4-1.6 g/kg
*   **Peak Training Day (4-5 hours):**
    *   Carbs: 8-12 g/kg
    *   Protein: 1.6-2.0 g/kg

### 3.2. Protein Timing
*   **Frequency:** Consume 0.3 g/kg (20-40g) every 3-5 hours.
*   **Post-Workout:** Critical window, especially if <8 hours until next session.
*   **Bedtime:** Casein or slow-digesting protein to support overnight repair.

## 4. Workout Fueling Protocols

### 4.1. Pre-Workout
*   **Timing:** 1-4 hours before exercise.
*   **Goal:** Top off liver glycogen.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   3-4 hours out: 1-4 g/kg (large meal).
    *   1 hour out: 0.5-1 g/kg (snack, low fiber/fat).
*   **Fasted Training:** Only for low-intensity sessions ("Train Low") to enhance metabolic adaptations. Never for key workouts.

### 4.2. During Workout
*   **<45 min:** No carb required.
*   **45-75 min:** Carb mouth rinse or small amounts.
*   **1-2.5 hours:** 30-60g/hour (single source ok).
*   **>2.5 hours (Marathon):** 60-90g/hour (Dual Source Glucose:Fructose 2:1).
*   **Gut Training:** Practice high intake (90g/hr) over 6-8 weeks to upregulate transporters (SGLT1, GLUT5) and reduce GI distress.

### 4.3. Post-Workout Recovery
*   **Normal Recovery (>24h gap):** Daily totals matter most.
*   **Rapid Recovery (<8h gap):**
    *   1.0-1.2 g/kg carbs per hour for first 4 hours.
    *   Add 0.3 g/kg protein.
    *   Caffeine (3-8 mg/kg) can boost glycogen resynthesis by 66%.

## 5. Race Week & Race Day

### 5.1. Carbohydrate Loading (The "Modern" Protocol)
*   **Timing:** 36-48 hours before race start.
*   **Target:** 10-12 g/kg bodyweight per day.
*   **Method:** Reduce fat/protein, drastically increase carbs. No depletion phase needed.
*   **Expected Weight Gain:** 1-2kg (water weight with glycogen) - beneficial for hydration.

### 5.2. Race Day Execution
*   **Breakfast:** 1-4 g/kg, 3-4 hours pre-race. Low fiber/fat.
*   **Pre-Start:** Small snack/gel 15-30 min prior.
*   **During Race:**
    *   Target: 60-90g/hour.
    *   Start early (mile 3-6).
    *   Consistency: Every 15-20 mins.
*   **Hydration:** Drink to thirst (prevent hyponatremia). Sodium 300-600mg/hr if heavy sweater.
*   **Caffeine:** 3-6 mg/kg 60 min pre-race for endurance benefit.

## 6. App Features & Integration

### 6.1. Calculator & Planning
*   **Macro Calculator:** Input weight/training load -> Output daily gram targets.
*   **Fueling Strategy Builder:** Create a plan for long runs/races (e.g., "Take Gel at 5km, 10km...").

### 6.2. Contextual Advice
*   **Coach's Note Integration:** "Tomorrow is a long run. Eat ~Xg carbs at dinner tonight."
*   **Post-Run Notification:** "Hard session done. Aim for 60g carbs + 20g protein ASAP."

### 6.3. Gut Training Tracker
*   Log fueling success/failure (GI distress) during long runs to refine race day strategy.

## 7. Success Metrics
*   **Fueling Adherence:** % of long runs with adequate fueling logged.
*   **GI Distress Reduction:** Decrease in reported stomach issues over time.
*   **Race Energy:** User reported energy levels in final 10km of marathon.
