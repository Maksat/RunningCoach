# PRD: Running Drills & Technique

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the running drills, plyometric protocols, and technique training integrated into marathon preparation. Research shows structured drill work produces **4-7% running economy improvements** through enhanced neuromuscular coordination and tendon stiffness.

## 2. Research Foundation
*   **Plyometric Hopping:** 6 weeks of 5 min/day hopping improved economy by 4-7% and increased Achilles tendon stiffness by 16%
*   **Combined Approach:** Drills + plyometrics + technique focus yield greater benefits than any single modality
*   **Frequency:** 2-3×/week during base phase, 1-2×/week during build/peak for maintenance
*   **Timing:** Perform BEFORE easy runs when fresh, NOT before hard workouts or after long runs

## 3. Plyometric Hopping Protocol (Highest ROI)

### 3.1. Research-Backed 6-Week Protocol
Produces 4-7% economy improvement in just 6 weeks with 5 minutes daily investment.

**Progressive Volume:**
*   **Week 1:** 12 sets × 10 sec hopping, 15 sec rest = 5 min total
*   **Week 2:** 16 sets × 10 sec hopping, 12 sec rest = 5.9 min total
*   **Week 3:** 20 sets × 10 sec hopping, 10 sec rest = 6.7 min total
*   **Week 4:** 24 sets × 10 sec hopping, 7 sec rest = 6.8 min total
*   **Week 5:** 26 sets × 10 sec hopping, 6 sec rest = 6.9 min total
*   **Week 6:** 28 sets × 10 sec hopping, 5 sec rest = 7 min total

**Form Cues:**
*   Hop as high as possible on both feet
*   Minimize ground contact time (<250ms ideal)
*   Keep knees extended throughout (stiff-leg hopping)
*   Land on forefoot/midfoot, not heels
*   Use arms for momentum (swing up during hop)
*   Focus on explosive upward force, not forward distance

**Mechanism:** Increases Achilles tendon stiffness by 16%, which reduces oxygen consumption by 4% through improved elastic energy return.

### 3.2. Integration into Training
*   **When:** Before easy runs, 2-3×/week
*   **Not After:** Long runs, hard workouts, or when fatigued
*   **Surface:** Firm surface (track, grass, turf)—avoid concrete for impact reasons
*   **Progression:** Start Week 1 protocol regardless of fitness; progress weekly

## 4. Core Running Drills

### 4.1. A-Skips
**Purpose:** Hip flexor activation, midfoot striking pattern, cadence development

**Execution:**
*   Skip forward with exaggerated knee lift
*   Opposite arm drives forward
*   Land on midfoot with quick ground contact
*   Focus on "pawing" motion (foot pulls back before ground contact)

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 20-30 meters

### 4.2. B-Skips
**Purpose:** Hip extension, hamstring activation, running-specific ROM

**Execution:**
*   Like A-skip, but extend leg forward after knee lift
*   Pull leg down aggressively to ground
*   Land on midfoot with "pawing" motion
*   Emphasize hamstring activation in downward pull

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 20-30 meters

### 4.3. High Knees
**Purpose:** Hip flexor strength, cadence, knee lift

**Execution:**
*   Run in place or move slowly forward
*   Drive knees to hip height
*   Quick ground contact
*   Pump arms vigorously
*   Maintain upright posture

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 20-30 seconds or 20-30 meters

### 4.4. Butt Kicks
**Purpose:** Hamstring flexibility, heel recovery, leg turnover

**Execution:**
*   Kick heels to glutes
*   Lean slightly forward
*   Quick leg turnover
*   Minimal forward progress—focus on recovery phase

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 20-30 seconds or 20-30 meters

### 4.5. Bounding
**Purpose:** Power development, stride length, elastic energy utilization

**Execution:**
*   Exaggerated running stride
*   Maximize "hang time" and horizontal distance per bound
*   Powerful arm drive
*   Land midfoot, immediately spring into next bound
*   Focus on force production, not speed

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 30-50 meters

### 4.6. Straight-Leg Bounds (Russian March)
**Purpose:** Hamstring flexibility, hip extension ROM

**Execution:**
*   Keep legs straight throughout
*   Kick one leg forward to hip height
*   Land on that leg, immediately kick opposite leg forward
*   Arms reach toward kicked foot
*   Slow, controlled movement

**Volume:** 2-3 sets × 20-30 meters

### 4.7. Carioca (Grapevine)
**Purpose:** Hip mobility, lateral movement, coordination

**Execution:**
*   Face perpendicular to direction of travel
*   Cross one foot over the other, then behind
*   Rotate hips, keep shoulders square
*   Quick feet, smooth rhythm

**Volume:** 2 sets × 20-30 meters each direction

## 5. Strides (Accelerations)
**Purpose:** Neuromuscular recruitment, form reinforcement, race pace practice

**Execution:**
*   Gradual acceleration to 85-90% max speed over 50-80m
*   Maintain for 10-20m
*   Gradual deceleration
*   Focus on relaxed form, quick turnover, tall posture

**Volume:** 4-8 × 80-100m with full recovery (walk back to start)

**When:** After easy runs 2-3×/week, especially during base phase

## 6. Periodization Across Training Phases

### 6.1. Base Phase (8-12 weeks)
**Frequency:** 2-3×/week before easy runs
**Focus:** Plyometric hopping protocol (6-week progressive), all drills for technique foundation
**Volume:** Full drill circuit (15-20 min) + 4-6 strides

**Rationale:** Lower running volume allows time and energy for drill work; establishes neuromuscular patterns

### 6.2. Build Phase (6-8 weeks)
**Frequency:** 2×/week (reduced from base due to higher running intensity)
**Focus:** Maintain plyometric work, prioritize A/B-skips and bounding (running-specific power)
**Volume:** Abbreviated circuit (10 min) + 4 strides

**Rationale:** Running intensity increasing, maintain adaptations without excessive fatigue

### 6.3. Peak Phase (6-8 weeks)
**Frequency:** 1×/week maintenance only
**Focus:** Plyometric hopping + strides
**Volume:** 5 min hopping + 4-6 strides

**Rationale:** Running volume/intensity peaks, minimal drill work to preserve neuromuscular adaptations without adding fatigue

### 6.4. Taper Phase (2-3 weeks)
**Frequency:** 1×/week light work during week 1-2 of taper, ZERO final week
**Focus:** Short strides only (no plyometrics final 10 days)
**Volume:** 4 × 80m strides at easy-moderate effort

**Rationale:** Maintain leg turnover feel without muscular fatigue before race

## 7. Form & Safety

### 7.1. Warm-Up Requirements
*   Perform drills AFTER 10-15 min easy running warm-up
*   Never perform plyometrics or drills cold
*   Dynamic stretching (leg swings, walking lunges) before drill work

### 7.2. Surface Selection
*   **Preferred:** Track (rubber), grass, turf (soft but firm)
*   **Acceptable:** Paved path if smooth
*   **Avoid:** Concrete (high impact), uneven trails (ankle risk), sand (excessive instability)

### 7.3. Fatigue Management
*   Skip drill work if excessively sore or fatigued
*   Quality > quantity—stop if form deteriorates
*   Never perform plyometrics day before or after long runs/hard workouts

### 7.4. Injury Red Flags
*   Achilles pain during hopping → Stop immediately, ice, rest
*   Sharp knee pain during bounding → Reduce intensity or skip
*   Hip flexor strain during high knees → Reduce ROM, strengthen hip flexors separately

## 8. Exercise Library & Instruction

### 8.1. Video Demonstrations
*   **Front View:** Shows body alignment, arm action
*   **Side View:** Shows leg mechanics, ground contact
*   **Slow Motion:** Breaks down key positions
*   **Common Mistakes:** Shows incorrect form with corrections

### 8.2. Form Cues
Each drill includes 3-5 concise form cues:
*   "Pawing motion before ground contact" (A-skips)
*   "Quick ground contact, minimize time on ground" (all drills)
*   "Tall posture, no leaning back" (high knees, butt kicks)

### 8.3. Progression Tracking
*   Track weekly completion (yes/no)
*   Optional: Video upload for form analysis (future feature)
*   Coach's Note feedback: "Your drill consistency this month improved your cadence by 3 SPM!"

## 9. Integration with Mobile App

If easy run scheduled and drill day (2-3×/week), display prompt:
*   "Today is a drill day. Complete 15-minute circuit before your run?"
*   Option to skip, defer, or start drill timer

### 9.2. Drill Timer Feature
*   Guided intervals: "A-skips: GO. 30 seconds... Done. Rest 30 seconds... Next: B-skips"
*   Audio cues and haptic feedback
*   Built-in rest timers between sets
*   Progress bar showing completion

### 9.3. Plyometric Hopping Timer
*   Week-specific protocol loaded automatically
*   "Week 3: 20 sets × 10 sec hopping, 10 sec rest. Ready? Start!"
*   Countdown for work and rest intervals
*   Motivational prompts: "Set 10 of 20—halfway there!"

## 10. Success Metrics
