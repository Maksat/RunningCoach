# PRD: Cross-Training & Injury Rehabilitation

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the cross-training protocols and injury rehabilitation guidelines that enable fitness maintenance when running is reduced or impossible. Research shows properly structured cross-training can maintain marathon fitness for up to **6 weeks** without land running.

## 2. Research Foundation
*   **Deep Water Running:** Maintains VO2max and running economy for 6 weeks without any land running
*   **Cycling Substitution:** 50% cycling replacement maintains performance for 5 weeks (3000m times only 1.4% slower)
*   **Detraining Timeline:** First 2 weeks of no training shows 4-7% VO2max decline but full recoverability; beyond 4 weeks requires 1.5-2× interruption period for recovery
*   **Minimum Effective Dose:** 1 high-intensity session/week + 50% normal easy volume maintains VO2max for 4+ weeks

## 3. Cross-Training Modalities

### 3.1. Deep Water Running (DWR) - Gold Standard

#### Evidence Base
*   Most running-specific cross-training modality
*   No decline in VO2max or running economy during 6-week substitution in elite runners
*   8-week protocol (3×/week, 65 min) improved VO2max from 45.3 to 49.7 mL/kg/min

#### Optimal Protocol
**Session Structure (65 minutes):**
*   5 min warm-up at easy effort
*   50 min interval work:
    *   3 cycles of:
        *   3 min hard (severe RPE)
        *   2 min moderate
        *   Repeat 3 times
    *   2 min break between cycles
*   10 min cool-down

**Form Cues:**
*   Vertical or slightly forward-leaning position
*   Head lifted, chin pulled in
*   Shoulder blades together and down
*   Core engaged (pull belly to spine)
*   Arms bent 90°, swinging like pendulums
*   Legs: start with vertical flutter kick, gradually open stride

**Equipment:**
*   Flotation belt for proper vertical positioning
*   Pool depth minimum 5'5"

#### Equivalency & Load Accounting
*   **Time Ratio:** 1:1 (60 min DWR = 60 min running in training effect)
*   **Heart Rate:** Runs 10-15 bpm lower than land at same exertion (hydrostatic pressure + cooling)
*   **Load Calculation:** Same Session RPE × Duration as running
*   **Running Volume Credit:** 100% (fully maintains running-specific adaptations up to 6 weeks)

#### Limitations
*   Cannot achieve same peak HR as land running
*   Better for maintenance than building fitness
*   Hip flexor injuries may be aggravated
*   Requires pool access
*   Reduced running-specific neuromuscular patterns beyond 6 weeks

### 3.2. Cycling

#### Evidence Base
*   50% substitution maintains performance during 5-week recuperative phases
*   High-intensity cycling (5×5min intervals >95% VO2max) produces similar improvements to run-only training

#### Equivalency & Load Accounting
*   **Time Ratio:** 3:1 (90 min cycling ≈ 30 min running)
*   **Heart Rate Target:** 10-15 bpm lower than running endurance pace
*   **Cadence:** 80-100 rpm for running-specific cardiovascular benefits
*   **Energy Expenditure:** ~2× time on bike to match running calorie burn
*   **Load Calculation:** Session RPE × Duration
*   **Running Volume Credit:** 30-50% (partial running-specific transfer)

#### Effective Workouts

**Endurance Rides (60-120 minutes):**
*   Alternate 10 min hard + 2 min easy
*   HR maintained 10 bpm below running endurance HR throughout

**Interval Sessions (45-60 minutes):**
*   8-14 × 2 min hard (>80% max HR) + 2 min easy recovery
*   Substitutes for track workouts

**Hill/Strength Sessions:**
*   1-3 min climbs
*   Recovery 50% as long as work intervals
*   Builds quad strength for downhill running

#### Limitations
*   Quad-dominant, less hamstring/calf activation
*   Seated position ≠ standing running biomechanics
*   Knee issues possible with improper bike fit
*   Lower neuromuscular specificity than DWR
*   Longer cycling-only periods require careful return-to-running progression

### 3.3. Elliptical Training

#### Evidence Base
*   Closest machine-based approximation to running gait
*   Improved functional movement scores
*   Similar cardiovascular benefits with significant impact reduction

#### Equivalency & Load Accounting
*   **Time Ratio:** 2:1 (2000 strides ≈ 1 mile run, depending on stride length and intensity)
*   **Load Calculation:** Session RPE × Duration
*   **Running Volume Credit:** 50-70%

#### Best Applications
*   Active recovery days at 60-70% max HR
*   Injury rehabilitation
*   Supplementing high mileage weeks
*   Can replace 1-2 easy runs/week without compromising marathon fitness

#### Workouts

**Recovery Sessions:**
*   60-90 min at truly easy effort (can read/watch content)
*   RPE 3-4/10

**Interval Sessions:**
*   8-14 × 2 min hard (>80% max HR) + 2 min easy
*   RPE 7-8/10 during intervals

### 3.4. Rowing Machine

#### Evidence Base
*   Engages 86% of muscles
*   Emphasis on posterior chain (hips, hamstrings, glutes) supporting running posture

#### Equivalency & Load Accounting
*   **Unclear Equivalency:** Some report 10km row ≈ 10km run time
*   **Effort-Based Estimate:** 12-15 min rowing ≈ 1 mile running
*   **Heart Rate:** 10-15 bpm lower than running at similar effort
*   **Load Calculation:** Session RPE × Duration
*   **Running Volume Credit:** 40-60%

#### Best Applications
*   Full-body conditioning
*   Posterior chain strengthening
*   Recovery from high-impact weeks
*   Requires proper technique coaching for effectiveness

#### Workouts

**Anaerobic Threshold Development:**
*   4-6 × 4 min at 71-85% max HR + 2 min rest

**Max Power Development:**
*   8 × 20 seconds all-out + 90 seconds easy

### 3.5. Swimming

#### Evidence Base
*   Minimum transfer to running performance
*   Benefits half the improvement of additional running (13.2 vs 26.4 seconds for same training volume)
*   Horizontal position + upper-body dominance limit running-specific adaptations

#### Equivalency & Load Accounting
*   **Time Ratio:** 4:1 (1500m swim ≈ 6km run)
*   **Load Calculation:** Session RPE × Duration
*   **Running Volume Credit:** 20-30% (minimal running-specific transfer)

#### Best Applications
*   Upper body injuries preventing weight-bearing exercise
*   Mental breaks from running
*   Supplemental low-impact aerobic work
*   Non-impact recovery
*   Requires swimming proficiency for adequate intensity

## 4. Injury Rehabilitation Protocols

### 4.1. Graduated Return-to-Training Phases

#### Acute Phase (Days 1-7)
*   **Goal:** Protect injury while maintaining cardiovascular fitness
*   **Running:** Complete rest
*   **Cross-Training:** Non-weight-bearing only (pool, cycling)
*   **Pain Threshold:** Stay below 3/10 during activity
*   **Example:** 30-45 min easy DWR or cycling daily

#### Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 2-4)
*   **Goal:** Progressive loading while building fitness
*   **Running:** None or minimal (if pain-free)
*   **Cross-Training:** Increase volume and intensity progressively
*   **Strength/Mobility:** Injury-specific rehab exercises
*   **Example:** 45-60 min DWR with intervals + cycling for additional volume = 60-90 min daily

#### Transition Phase (Weeks 4-6)
*   **Goal:** Gradual return to running
*   **Running:** Run-walk approach, progress 10% weekly
*   **Cross-Training:** Continue for volume maintenance
*   **Pain Threshold:** Never exceed 3/10 during or after activity
*   **Example:**
    *   3 days running: Week 1 = 20 min run-walk, Week 2 = 22 min, Week 3 = 24 min
    *   3 days cross-training: Maintain cardiovascular fitness

### 4.2. Return-to-Sport After Illness

Research-backed 5-stage protocol requiring **minimum 10 days rest** and **7 days symptom-free** before beginning:

#### Illness Severity Rules
*   **Fever > 100.4°F (38°C):** ABSOLUTE REST. No exceptions.
*   **Below Neck Symptoms:** (Chest congestion, body aches) -> Complete Rest until 24-48h symptom-free.
*   **Above Neck Symptoms:** (Runny nose, scratchy throat) -> Caution (50% intensity).
*   **Return Rule:** 3 days of graded return for every 1 day of illness.

#### Stage 1 (Days 1-2 After Symptom-Free)
*   Light activity only: walking or light jogging <15 min
*   RPE 2-3/10
*   Proceed only if can walk 500m without excessive fatigue

#### Stage 2 (Days 3-4)
*   Easy running 20-30 min at 50-60% normal intensity
*   RPE 4-5/10

#### Stage 3 (Days 5-6)
*   Steady runs with brief pickups
*   30-45 min at 60-75% normal intensity

#### Stage 4 (Days 7-9)
*   Include one workout at 75-90% normal intensity
*   45-60 minutes

#### Stage 5 (Days 10+)
*   Resume full training
*   Monitor for 2 weeks for symptom recurrence

#### Red Flags (Return to Previous Stage)
*   Resting HR elevated >5 bpm above baseline
*   Elevated RPE at given paces
*   Poor sleep quality
*   Any respiratory symptoms

**General Guideline:** 2-3 days recovery per day of illness

### 4.3. Injury-Specific Cross-Training Guidance

**Stress Fractures:**
*   DWR and cycling avoiding impact completely
*   No running until medical clearance (typically 6-8 weeks)
*   **Return Criteria:** Pain-free walking 45+ mins, radiological healing, single-leg hop 75-80% symmetry.

**Plantar Fasciitis & Achilles Tendinopathy:**
*   Cycling (non-weight-bearing)
*   Rowing (seated, no impact)
*   Swimming with pull buoy (avoid kick)
*   **Return Criteria:** Pain ≤5/10 during activity, settles to baseline by next morning. 25 single-leg heel raises pain-free.

**Hip Injuries:**
*   Swimming with pull buoy (avoid leg drive)
*   Upper body work
*   Avoid DWR initially

**Knee Issues:**
*   Careful cycling (bike fit critical)
*   Prefer DWR or swimming
*   Monitor for pain during/after

**Shin Splints:**
*   DWR or elliptical (reduced impact)
*   Swimming
*   Avoid hard surfaces

**Hamstring & Calf Strains:**
*   Gentle cycling preferred
*   Avoid DWR initially (eccentric load)
*   Progress gradually with ROM increases

## 5. Maximum Substitution Timeframes

### 5.1. Short-Term (<2 Weeks)
*   Plasma volume decreases, early VO2max declines 4-7%
*   Muscular adaptations stable
*   **Strategy:** Full cross-training substitution acceptable
*   **Return:** Resume at 80-90% previous volume

### 5.2. Medium-Term (2-4 Weeks)
*   VO2max declines 4-8%
*   Endurance capacity decreases
*   **Strategy:** Maintain 1 high-intensity session/week + 50% easy volume via cross-training
*   **Return:** Requires ~equivalent time to restore (3-week break needs 3 weeks rebuilding)

### 5.3. Long-Term (4-6 Weeks)
*   Accelerated decline beyond 4 weeks
*   Running-specific neuromuscular patterns degrading
*   **Strategy (DWR):** Can substitute ALL running for up to 6 weeks
*   **Strategy (Cycling):** 50% substitution maintains performance for 5 weeks
*   **Return:** May require 1.5-2× interruption period for full restoration

### 5.4. Extended (>6 Weeks)
*   Significant running-specific deconditioning
*   General aerobic fitness preserved with cross-training
*   **Strategy:** Combine multiple modalities (3-4 days DWR + 2-3 days cycling)
*   **Return:** Requires extended rebuild period, treat as returning from off-season

## 6. Minimum Effective Dose for Marathon Readiness

When circumstances limit training availability:

*   **Absolute Minimum:** 3 sessions/week totaling 40+ km (25 miles)
*   **Critical Session:** At least one long run minimum 13 miles, ideally 16-20 miles
*   **Maintenance:** 1 high-intensity session/week + 50% normal easy volume
*   **Timeline:** Maintaining for 4+ weeks, then requires rebuild

Dropping below these thresholds compromises marathon-specific adaptations.

## 7. Integration with Load Management

### 7.1. ACWR Calculations
*   All cross-training activities included in total load via Session RPE × Duration
*   Track running-specific volume separately
*   Monitor that cross-training substitution maintains ACWR within 0.8-1.3

### 7.2. Traffic Light System Application
*   Red light signals may indicate cross-training instead of complete rest
*   Yellow light modifications include cross-training substitution
*   Green light allows full running—cross-training supplemental

### 7.3. Recovery Week Protocols
*   Cross-training volume also reduced by 20-25% during recovery weeks
*   Can maintain slightly higher cross-training volume than running (lower impact)

## 8. User Experience

### 8.1. Activity Logging
*   Predefined cross-training activity types (DWR, cycling, elliptical, rowing, swimming, other)
*   Auto-calculate equivalent running volume based on ratios
*   Session RPE required for all activities
*   Equipment/facility notes (pool availability, bike type, etc.)

### 8.2. Substitution Recommendations
*   When injury or illness detected, system recommends appropriate cross-training modality
*   Provides equivalent workout structure (e.g., "Your planned 60 min easy run → 60 min easy DWR")
*   Explains why specific modality chosen based on injury type

### 8.3. Progress Tracking
*   Separate running vs. total training volume charts
*   Cross-training proportion over time
*   Return-to-running progression tracking post-injury

## 9. Success Metrics
*   **Fitness Maintenance:** VO2max proxy maintained within 5% during cross-training periods >3 weeks
*   **Injury Recovery:** Average return-to-full-training timeline ≤ research-based expectations
*   **Protocol Adherence:** ≥85% compliance with graduated return-to-sport protocols
*   **Performance Preservation:** Post-injury performance returns to within 95% of pre-injury baseline within 2× injury layoff period
