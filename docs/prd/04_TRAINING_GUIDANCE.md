# PRD: Training Guidance & Workout Specifications

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the specific workout types, intensity targets, and coaching guidance that form the core training experience. It translates the "Holistic Coach" vision into concrete prescriptions, ensuring every workout serves the goal of a personal best while respecting the athlete's body.

## 2. Core Training Principles

### 2.1. The 4-Pillar Approach
We do not just prescribe running. We prescribe a **holistic regimen**:
1.  **Run:** The engine builder.
2.  **Strength:** The chassis reinforcement (Injury Prevention).
3.  **Fuel:** The energy source (Nutrition).
4.  **Recover:** The adaptation trigger (Sleep/Rest).

### 2.2. Intensity Distribution (Polarized)
*   **80% Easy:** Zone 1/2. Builds mitochondria without frying the CNS.
*   **20% Hard:** Zone 4/5. Specific race adaptations.
*   **The "Grey Zone" Ban:** We avoid "moderately hard" running that fatigues without specific benefit.

## 3. Workout Type Specifications

### 3.1. Running Workouts
*   **Easy Run:** "Conversation pace." Purpose: Aerobic volume.
*   **Long Run:** The key marathon builder. Purpose: Glycogen depletion, fat oxidation, mental resilience.
*   **Threshold (Tempo):** "Comfortably hard." Purpose: Raise the lactate ceiling.
*   **Intervals (VO2max):** "Hard." Purpose: Leg speed and max aerobic capacity.
*   **Recovery Run:** "Embarrassingly slow." Purpose: Blood flow, movement patterns.

### 3.2. Strength & Prehab (Mandatory)
*   **Frequency:** 2x/week (Heavy), Daily (Prehab/Mobility).
*   **Key Movements:**
    *   **Nordic Curls:** Hamstring resilience.
    *   **Calf Raises:** Achilles protection.
    *   **Single-Leg Deadlifts:** Balance and glute activation.
    *   **Planks/Pallof Press:** Core stability.
*   **Timing:** Ideally post-hard run (keep hard days hard) or on cross-training days.

### 3.3. Nutrition & Fueling
*   **Daily:** "Eat enough to recover." (Calorie balance).
*   **Pre-Workout:** "Carbs = Gas." (e.g., Banana/Toast 30m before).
*   **Intra-Workout (Runs > 90m):** 60-90g carbs/hour. Train the gut.
*   **Post-Workout:** Protein + Carbs within 60m.

## 4. Life Event Protocols (The "Adaptive" Part)

### 4.1. "I'm Sick" Protocol
*   **Rule:** "Neck Check."
    *   **Above Neck (Cold):** Reduce intensity 50%. No intervals.
    *   **Below Neck (Fever/Chest):** **STOP.** Complete rest.
*   **Return to Run:**
    *   Day 1 post-fever: Rest.
    *   Day 2: 20m Walk.
    *   Day 3: 20m Easy Jog.
    *   Day 4: Resume plan (modified).

### 4.2. "I'm Traveling" Protocol
*   **Constraint:** Limited time, no gym, stress.
*   **Adjustment:** Switch to "Maintenance Mode."
    *   **Workout:** 30m Fartlek (Speed play). High ROI, low time cost.
    *   **Strength:** Bodyweight circuit in hotel room.
    *   **Goal:** Maintain blood volume and neuromuscular paths. Don't try to build fitness.

### 4.3. "I Missed a Workout" Protocol
*   **Rule:** **Never catch up.**
*   **Logic:**
    *   Missed Easy Run? Forget it.
    *   Missed Long Run? Move to next week (if phase allows) or swap with next week's medium run.
    *   Missed Intervals? Skip. Better to be slightly undertrained than injured.

## 5. Coaching Tone & Philosophy

### 5.1. The Trusted Advisor
*   **Not a Cheerleader:** We don't say "You can do it!" when you're injured.
*   **We say:** "Your calf is tight. We are skipping the intervals to save your marathon."
*   **Transparent:** "We assigned this long run because your aerobic base needs a boost before the taper."

### 5.2. Mental Resilience
*   **The "Dip":** We warn users about the Week 8 slump.
*   **Process over Outcome:** "Nail the workout, don't worry about the race today."
