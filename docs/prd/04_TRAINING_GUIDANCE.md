# PRD: Training Guidance & Workout Specifications

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the specific workout types, intensity targets, educational content, and coaching guidance that form the core training experience in RunningCoach. It translates evidence-based periodization principles into concrete workout prescriptions and actionable athlete guidance.

**Target Audience:** Training algorithm developers, content writers, coaching AI developers.

## 2. Core Training Principles

### 2.1. Intensity Distribution
Research on elite marathon runners confirms the **polarized training model** produces superior outcomes:
*   **Zone 1 (Easy):** 75-80% of total training time - below first ventilatory threshold
*   **Zone 2 (Tempo/Threshold):** 5-10% of training time - between ventilatory thresholds
*   **Zone 3 (Hard/VO2max):** 15-20% of training time - above second ventilatory threshold

**Implementation:** The system monitors weekly intensity distribution and alerts if deviating significantly from 80/20 easy/hard split.

### 2.2. Minimum Effective Dose
Marathon-specific adaptations require:
*   **Minimum 3 sessions weekly** totaling 40+ km (25+ miles)
*   **Longest run minimum:** 13 miles, ideally 16-20 miles
*   Training below these thresholds compromises race-day preparedness

### 2.3. Recovery Between Quality Sessions
*   **Minimum 48 hours** between hard workouts (intervals, tempo, long runs)
*   Back-to-back hard sessions increase injury risk without additional adaptation benefit
*   Quality over quantity for intensity work

## 3. Workout Type Specifications

### 3.1. Easy Runs (Zone 1)
**Purpose:** Build aerobic base, facilitate recovery, maintain training consistency.

**Intensity:** <Lactate Threshold HR (~70-80% Max HR)
*   Conversational pace - able to speak full sentences
*   RPE: 2-4 out of 10

**Duration/Distance:**
*   **Base Phase:** 30-60 minutes, 5-10 km
*   **Build Phase:** 45-75 minutes, 8-12 km
*   **Peak Phase:** 60-90 minutes, 10-15 km

**Frequency:** 3-5 times weekly (most common workout type)

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "Focus on time on feet today—pace doesn't matter. This easy effort builds mitochondrial density and capillary networks that fuel marathon performance."
*   "Keep it truly easy. You should be able to hold a conversation throughout."

### 3.2. Long Runs
**Purpose:** Build marathon-specific endurance, teach body to burn fat efficiently, strengthen connective tissue.

**Intensity:** Zone 1 (Easy pace), may include marathon pace segments in later phases
*   RPE: 3-5 out of 10 for easy portions, 5-6 for marathon pace segments

**Progression:**
*   **Base Phase (Weeks 1-12):** 60 minutes → 120 minutes (gradual progression)
*   **Build Phase (Weeks 13-20):** 90-150 minutes, introduce marathon pace segments
*   **Peak Phase (Weeks 21-24):** 120-180 minutes, 16-20 mile peak long runs
*   **Taper (Weeks 25-26):** 60-90 minutes maximum

**Frequency:** Once weekly, typically Saturday or Sunday

**Key Guidelines:**
*   Increase by 10-15 minutes every 2-3 weeks (NOT every week)
*   Recovery week: Cut 40-50% of distance (e.g., 20 miles → 10-12 miles)
*   Never exceed 30% of weekly volume in single run
*   Include 48-72 hour recovery after peak long runs

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "This long run teaches your body to spare glycogen and burn fat—critical for miles 20-26. Keep it conversational."
*   "Today's 18-miler includes 8 miles at marathon pace. This builds confidence you can sustain race pace when already fatigued."

### 3.3. Tempo Runs (Zone 2 - Threshold)
**Purpose:** Improve lactate threshold, teach sustainable hard pace, build mental toughness.

**Intensity:** Lactate Threshold HR (approximately 85-90% Max HR)
*   "Comfortably hard" - can speak short phrases but not hold conversation
*   RPE: 6-7 out of 10

**Duration:**
*   **Base Phase:** 20-30 minutes continuous
*   **Build Phase:** 25-40 minutes continuous
*   **Peak Phase:** 30-45 minutes continuous (or as interval segments)

**Structure Options:**
*   **Continuous:** 10 min warmup + 20-40 min threshold + 10 min cooldown
*   **Tempo Intervals:** 10 min warmup + 3-4 × 8-10 min @ threshold (2 min recovery) + 10 min cooldown

**Frequency:** Once every 7-10 days during build and peak phases

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "Tempo pace is 'comfortably hard.' You're working but could maintain this for an hour. This workout raises the ceiling on your sustainable pace."
*   "Today's tempo builds the metabolic machinery for marathon pace. Don't go too hard—sustainable effort is the goal."

### 3.4. Interval Training (Zone 3 - VO2max)
**Purpose:** Develop VO2max, improve running economy, increase leg turnover.

**Intensity:** >90% Max HR, approximately 5K race pace or faster
*   RPE: 8-9 out of 10 during work intervals
*   Recovery RPE: 3-4 out of 10

**Classic Structures:**

**Short Intervals (800m-1200m):**
*   10 min warmup + 6-10 × 800m @ VO2max pace (2-3 min recovery) + 10 min cooldown
*   10 min warmup + 5-8 × 1000m @ VO2max pace (2-3 min recovery) + 10 min cooldown

**Medium Intervals (1600m-2000m):**
*   10 min warmup + 4-6 × 1600m @ 5K pace (3-4 min recovery) + 10 min cooldown

**Progression:**
*   **Base Phase:** Not included (focus on building aerobic base)
*   **Build Phase:** Introduce once every 10-14 days
*   **Peak Phase:** Once every 7-10 days
*   **Taper:** One session 10-12 days before race at reduced volume (4×800m vs 8×800m)

**Recovery Intervals:** Active recovery at easy jog, typically 50-75% of work interval duration

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "Intervals develop your top-end speed and running economy. Nail the pace on each rep—quality over quantity. If you're fading, stop and convert to easy running."
*   "Today's 800m repeats train your VO2max—the engine size that drives your marathon ceiling. Full recovery between reps."

### 3.5. Marathon Pace Runs
**Purpose:** Practice goal race pace, build confidence, teach pacing discipline.

**Intensity:** Goal marathon pace (approximately 80-85% Max HR)
*   RPE: 5-6 out of 10 (sustainable but focused)

**Structure:**
*   Typically embedded within long runs during build and peak phases
*   Start with short segments, increase duration over time

**Progression:**
*   **Week 16-18:** 10 miles total, last 4 miles @ marathon pace
*   **Week 19-21:** 14 miles total, last 8 miles @ marathon pace
*   **Week 22-23:** 18-20 miles total, last 10 miles @ marathon pace

**Frequency:** Every 2-3 weeks during build/peak phases

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "Marathon pace should feel controlled and sustainable. If you're working too hard, slow down 10 seconds/mile. Race day success comes from disciplined pacing."
*   "Today's workout simulates running goal pace on tired legs—exactly what miles 20-26 will feel like. Trust the pace."

### 3.6. Recovery Runs
**Purpose:** Active recovery, maintain training consistency, flush metabolic waste products.

**Intensity:** Very easy, <70% Max HR
*   Significantly slower than easy run pace
*   RPE: 1-3 out of 10

**Duration:** 20-40 minutes, 3-6 km

**Timing:** Day after hard workouts or long runs

**Key Guidelines:**
*   Truly easy effort - err on side of too slow
*   Shorten or skip entirely if still feeling significant fatigue
*   No shame in walking breaks if needed

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "After yesterday's hard effort, today is active recovery. Keep it conversationally easy—this flushes metabolic waste and maintains movement patterns without digging a deeper recovery hole."

### 3.7. Strides (Accelerations)
**Purpose:** Improve running economy, increase leg turnover, maintain neuromuscular patterns.

**Structure:** 4-8 × 80-100 meters progressive acceleration
*   Build from easy pace to 5K pace over 20-25 seconds
*   Walk back to start for full recovery (90 seconds)

**Integration:**
*   2-3 times weekly after easy runs
*   Before interval sessions as specific warmup
*   Maintain throughout all training phases including taper (4 strides only)

**Coach's Note Examples:**
*   "Strides keep your legs feeling sharp without fatigue. Build smoothly to fast (not sprint) over 20 seconds, then ease back to recovery."

## 4. Phase-Specific Workout Distribution

### 4.1. Base Building Phase (Weeks 1-12)
**Focus:** Aerobic foundation, structural resilience, establish baseline load.

**Weekly Structure (Example):**

*   Last hard workout: 7-10 days before race
*   Trust the taper - fitness doesn't decline for 2 weeks

## 5. Pace Calculations & Zone Determination

### 5.1. HR-Based Zone Calculations
**Method:** Use Lactate Threshold HR (LTHR) as primary reference point.

**Zone Definitions:**
*   **Zone 1 (Easy):** <LTHR (approximately 70-80% Max HR)
*   **Zone 2 (Tempo/Threshold):** LTHR to LTHR+5 (approximately 85-90% Max HR)
*   **Zone 3 (VO2max/Hard):** >LTHR+10 (approximately 90-95% Max HR)

**LTHR Determination:**
*   Lab testing (gold standard)
*   Field test: 30-minute time trial at maximum sustainable effort - average HR of final 20 minutes
*   Estimated: 90% of Max HR

### 5.2. Pace-Based Equivalencies
**Using Jack Daniels' VDOT approach:**

If marathon goal = 4:00:00 (9:09/mile pace):
*   **Easy Pace:** 10:00-10:45/mile
*   **Marathon Pace:** 9:09/mile
*   **Tempo/Threshold Pace:** 8:20-8:40/mile
*   **Interval/VO2max Pace:** 7:40-7:50/mile (approximately 5K pace)
*   **Strides:** 7:00-7:20/mile (controlled fast, not sprint)

**Calculator:** System uses recent race times or time trials to calculate personalized paces across all zones.

### 5.3. Perceived Exertion (RPE) Guidance
**Borg CR-10 Scale:**
*   **0-1:** Rest to very light
*   **2-3:** Light (easy runs, recovery)
*   **4-5:** Moderate (long runs, marathon pace)
*   **6-7:** Hard (tempo/threshold)
*   **8-9:** Very hard (intervals, VO2max)
*   **10:** Maximum effort

**Primary Use:** Post-workout RPE collection for internal load calculation (RPE × Duration)

## 6. Educational Content & Coaching Philosophy

### 6.1. "Mild" Coaching Tone
**Principles:**
*   Educational, not prescriptive: Explain *why* not just *what*
*   Trust athlete intelligence: Provide context for decision-making
*   Non-intrusive: Suggestions, not demands
*   Celebrate progress: Acknowledge completed workouts and improvements
*   Normalize struggles: "Tough days are part of training" messaging
*   **Build Identity:** Use language that reinforces "runner" identity (e.g., "Runners show up, even for 15 minutes").

*   **Build Identity:** Use language that reinforces "runner" identity (e.g., "Runners show up, even for 15 minutes").

### 6.2. Audio Guided Runs
**Concept:** Immersive audio experiences that combine coaching cues, motivation, and music (optional).
**Format:**
1.  **Intro (2-5 mins):** Purpose of the run, mindset setting ("Leave the stress of the day behind").
2.  **Middle (The Work):**
    *   **Form Cues:** "Check your shoulders, are they relaxed?" (Every 10 mins).
    *   **Pace Checks:** "You should be able to talk right now."
    *   **Mindset Coaching:** "Mental Performance" clips during long runs (e.g., visualization techniques, dissociation strategies).
3.  **Outro (2 mins):** Summary, congratulations, recovery reminder.

### 6.3. Illness & "Neck Check"
✅ "Today's easy run builds aerobic capacity. Keep it conversational—this is where endurance is built."
❌ "You MUST run easy today. This is critical!"

✅ "Your HRV is lower than normal. Consider reducing today's intensity to support recovery."
❌ "Your HRV is terrible. Skip your workout."

### 6.2. Illness & "Neck Check"
*   **Fever > 100.4°F (38°C):** ABSOLUTE REST. No exceptions.
*   **Below Neck Symptoms:** (Chest congestion, body aches) -> Complete Rest.
*   **Above Neck Symptoms:** (Runny nose, scratchy throat) -> Caution (50% intensity).
*   **Return Rule:** 3 days of graded return for every 1 day of illness.

### 6.2. Workout Rationale ("Why This Workout?")
Each scheduled workout includes expandable educational content explaining:
*   **Physiological Purpose:** What adaptations this workout stimulates
*   **Phase Context:** How it fits into current training phase
*   **Long-term Benefit:** How this contributes to marathon success

**Example (Long Run):**
"Long runs are the cornerstone of marathon preparation. They teach your muscles to store more glycogen, increase mitochondrial density (your cellular energy factories), and build capillary networks that deliver oxygen efficiently. Perhaps most importantly, they teach your body to burn fat as fuel—critical for preserving glycogen for miles 20-26 when it matters most."

### 6.3. Science-Backed Insights
**Include throughout app:**
*   "Research shows 80% easy, 20% hard intensity distribution produces superior marathon outcomes in elite athletes."
*   "Tempo runs raise your lactate threshold—the pace you can sustain for 60+ minutes. Improving this by 10 seconds/mile can translate to 4-5 minutes off your marathon time."
*   "Nordic hamstring curls reduce injury risk by 51% according to meta-analysis of 8,459 athletes."

### 6.4. Psychology of Training
**Educate users on the "Dip":**
*   **Weeks 2-8 Warning:** "This is the hardest part. The excitement has faded, but the fitness hasn't arrived yet. Consistency now is what makes you a marathoner."
*   **Decision Fatigue:** "Don't decide *if* you will run today. Decide *when*. Automate the decision."

### 6.5. "Should I Run?" Decision Support
**Self-Assessment Checklist (for users debating skipping):**
1.  **Is it physical pain?** (Sharp/localized = Stop. Dull/generalized = Go).
2.  **Is it mental fatigue?** (Stressful day = Run easy/short. "Just don't want to" = Run 10 mins then decide).
3.  **Is it illness?** (Neck check rule).
**Guidance:** "If it's mental, the hardest step is the first one. Commit to 10 minutes. If you still hate it, walk home. You keep the streak alive."

## 7. Workout Modification Rules

### 7.1. Yellow Traffic Light Modifications
**When 1-2 readiness markers outside normal range:**

**Intensity Reduction (Option 1):**
*   Intervals: Reduce pace by 5-10 seconds/mile
*   Tempo: Reduce pace by 10-15 seconds/mile
*   Long run: No modification (already easy pace)

**Volume Reduction (Option 2):**
*   Intervals: Reduce reps by 25% (8×800m → 6×800m)
*   Tempo: Reduce duration by 20% (40 min → 32 min)
*   Long run: Reduce distance by 20% (18 miles → 14 miles)

**System Decision Logic:** Choose modification that maintains workout purpose while respecting fatigue state.

### 7.2. Red Traffic Light Modifications
**When 3+ readiness markers outside normal range:**
*   All workouts → Easy run 30-45 minutes or complete rest
*   Preserve training consistency without deepening fatigue hole

### 7.3. Failed Workout Protocols
**Single Poor Workout:** Monitor, no immediate change
**Two Consecutive Failed Quality Sessions:** 25% volume reduction next week
**Three+ Consecutive Failures:** Full recovery week (50-75% normal volume)
