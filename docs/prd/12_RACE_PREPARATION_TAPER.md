# PRD: Race Preparation & Taper

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the race preparation protocols, taper strategies, and race week/day execution plans that optimize marathon performance. Research shows proper tapering can improve performance by **2-6%** through physiological freshening while maintaining fitness.

## 2. Research Foundation
*   **Taper Duration:** 3 weeks for marathon (optimal for 4+ minute improvement)
*   **Volume Reduction:** 40-60% reduction with exponential taper (not linear)
*   **Intensity Maintenance:** Keep intensity of quality sessions, reduce duration not effort
*   **TSB Target:** Race day TSB of +10 to +25 indicates optimal freshness (athlete-specific)
*   **Carb Loading:** Modern protocol (10-12 g/kg for 36-48 hours) doubles glycogen stores without depletion phase
*   **HRV Response:** Should increase during taper—if it doesn't, may indicate overtraining or subclinical illness

## 3. Taper Protocol (Final 3 Weeks)

### 3.1. Exponential Volume Reduction
Research shows exponential taper superior to linear or step taper.

**Week 1 of Taper (Days -21 to -15):**
*   Reduce volume to 80-85% of peak week
*   Maintain frequency, reduce duration of sessions

**Week 2 of Taper (Days -14 to -8):**
*   Reduce volume to 60% of peak week
*   Maintain 2 quality sessions at race intensity (shortened duration)
*   Long run reduced to 60% of normal

**Race Week (Days -7 to -1):**
*   Reduce volume to 40% of peak week
*   1 short quality session early in week (Tuesday/Wednesday)
*   No long run—longest run 10-13km easy
*   Final 2-3 days: only short easy runs or complete rest

**Exponential Formula:** Volume(day) = Peak Volume × e^(-(days_to_race / taper_constant))

### 3.2. Intensity Management
*   **Keep intensity high:** Quality sessions at race pace or slightly faster
*   **Reduce duration:** 5km tempo instead of 10km, 6 × 400m instead of 12 × 400m
*   **Final Quality Session:** 5-8 days before race (Tuesday if Saturday race)
*   **Example:** Tuesday: 10 min warm-up + 4 × 1km @ goal pace + 10 min cool-down

### 3.3. Strength Training During Taper
*   **Week 2 Before Race:** 1 light session at 70% normal volume (Tuesday/Wednesday)
*   **Race Week:** Maximum 1 very light session Monday if essential, otherwise ZERO
*   **Final Week:** No strength training at all before marathon

### 3.4. Drills & Plyometrics
*   **Week 2:** 1 short drill session + 4 strides
*   **Race Week:** 4-6 × 80m strides Tuesday or Wednesday, ZERO plyometrics final 10 days

## 4. Physiological Markers & Monitoring

### 4.1. Expected Changes
*   **ACWR:** Naturally decreases toward 0.8 (acute load dropping, chronic load stable)—this is EXPECTED and beneficial
*   **TSB:** Shifts from negative (fatigued) to positive (fresh)—target +10 to +25 by race day
*   **HRV:** Should increase 5-10% above baseline—if declining, may indicate illness
*   **Resting HR:** Should decrease 2-5 bpm below baseline
*   **Body Weight:** May increase 1-2kg due to glycogen + water storage (BENEFICIAL, not concerning)

### 4.2. Red Flags
*   **HRV Not Improving:** May indicate inadequate taper or brewing illness
*   **Elevated Resting HR:** Sign of stress, poor sleep, or illness
*   **Persistent Fatigue:** Taper should increase energy—if still tired on race morning, may need extra rest day
*   **New Aches/Pains:** Address immediately—don't "push through" during taper

## 5. Carbohydrate Loading Protocol

### 5.1. Modern 36-48 Hour Protocol
**No depletion phase needed**—research shows direct loading equally effective.

**Timing:** Start 36-48 hours before race start
*   **Thursday evening** (if Saturday race)
*   **Friday** (full day of loading)
*   **Saturday morning** (race day breakfast)

**Target:** 10-12 g/kg bodyweight per day

**Example for 70kg athlete:**
*   Daily target: 700-840g carbs
*   Breakfast: 150g (large bowl oatmeal, banana, honey, juice)
*   Lunch: 200g (pasta, bread, fruit)
*   Dinner: 250g (rice/pasta, potatoes, dessert)
*   Snacks: 100-140g (sports drinks, gels, energy bars, fruit)

### 5.2. Macronutrient Adjustments
*   **Reduce Fat:** 15-20% of calories (lower than normal 25-30%)
*   **Reduce Protein:** 15-20% of calories (lower than training 20-25%)
*   **Maximize Carbs:** 60-70% of calories
*   **Reduce Fiber:** Avoid high-fiber foods day before race (GI comfort)

### 5.3. Expected Weight Gain
*   1-2kg increase is NORMAL and BENEFICIAL
*   Glycogen binds 3-4g water per gram stored
*   This water is used during race for thermoregulation and performance

## 6. Race Week Logistics

### 6.1. Race Week Checklist (Auto-Generated)
*   **Sunday (-6 days):** Register/pick up packet if local, easy 30-45 min run
*   **Monday (-5 days):** Easy 30 min run + 4 strides, gear check
*   **Tuesday (-4 days):** Short quality session (race pace practice), finalize race plan
*   **Wednesday (-3 days):** Easy 30 min run, start carb loading (if Saturday race)
*   **Thursday (-2 days):** Easy 20-30 min run or rest, continue carb loading, pack race bag
*   **Friday (-1 day):** 15-20 min shakeout run + 4 × 80m strides, final carb loading, early bed
*   **Saturday (Race Day):** Execute!

### 6.2. Travel Considerations
**If Racing Away From Home:**
*   Arrive 2-3 days early if possible (adjust to time zone, scout course)
*   Book accommodation within 1-2 miles of start line (minimize race morning travel)
*   Scout nutrition options near hotel (ensure carb-loading meals available)

### 6.3. Sleep Strategy
*   **Two Nights Before:** Most important—prioritize 8+ hours
*   **Night Before:** Expect poor sleep (race nerves normal), don't stress if only 5-6 hours
*   **Naps:** Short 20-30 min naps OK during race week, avoid >60 min (disrupts night sleep)

## 7. Race Day Execution

### 7.1. Morning Timeline (for 8:00 AM start)
*   **5:00 AM:** Wake, hydrate (500ml water)
*   **5:15 AM:** Breakfast (1-4 g/kg, low fiber/fat)—例: bagel, banana, energy bar, coffee
*   **6:00 AM:** Depart for start area
*   **6:30 AM:** Arrive, use bathroom
*   **6:45 AM:** Small snack/gel (30g carbs)
*   **7:00-7:30 AM:** Warm-up (10-15 min easy jog + 4 × 100m strides)
*   **7:45 AM:** Line up in corral, final bathroom visit
*   **7:55 AM:** Consume gel/chew (20-30g carbs) + water
*   **8:00 AM:** START

### 7.2. Fueling Strategy
**Pre-Race:**
*   3-4 hours before: 1-4 g/kg (large meal)
*   1 hour before: Small snack (0.5 g/kg)
*   15-30 min before: Gel/chew (20-30g carbs)

**During Race:**
*   **Target:** 60-90g carbs/hour using dual-source (glucose + fructose 2:1 ratio)
*   **Start Early:** Begin fueling at km 5-8, NOT km 15+
*   **Consistency:** Every 15-20 minutes (e.g., gel at 5km, 10km, 15km, etc.)
*   **Hydration:** Drink to thirst (prevent hyponatremia), sodium 300-600mg/hr if heavy sweater
*   **Caffeine:** Optional gel with caffeine in final 10km for mental boost

**Example Fueling Plan:**
*   5km: Gel (25g carbs)
*   10km: Sports drink (15g carbs) + water
*   15km: Gel (25g carbs)
*   20km: Chews (20g carbs) + water
*   25km: Gel (25g carbs)
*   30km: Sports drink (15g carbs)
*   35km: Caffeine gel (25g carbs)
*   40km: Chews if needed

**Total: ~165g carbs = 70g/hour average for 2.5-hour finish**

### 7.3. Pacing Strategy
**Generated by System based on training:**
*   Goal pace with confidence interval (e.g., "3:45:00 ± 5 minutes")
*   First 5km: 5-10 seconds/km slower than goal pace (avoid adrenaline surge)
*   Middle 30km: Settle into goal pace
*   Final 7km: Assess and push if feeling strong, maintain if struggling

**Negative Split Target:** Second half 1-2% faster than first half

### 7.4. Mental Preparation
*   **Visualization:** Practice seeing yourself strong at km 30-35 (typical struggle point)
*   **Mantras:** 3-5 word phrases ("Strong and steady," "I trained for this")
*   **Segmentation:** Break race into 4 × 10.5km segments mentally

## 8. Post-Race Recovery

### 8.1. Immediate (0-2 Hours Post)
*   Walk 10-15 minutes, don't sit immediately
*   Consume 1.0-1.2 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein within 30 minutes
*   Hydrate (sodium-containing fluids)
*   Change into dry, warm clothes

### 8.2. First Week Post-Race
*   **Days 1-3:** Complete rest or easy walking only
*   **Days 4-7:** Light cross-training (swimming, cycling) if feeling good
*   **Week 2:** Resume easy running (20-30 min max), no intensity
*   **Week 3-4:** Build back gradually to 50% normal volume

### 8.3. Return to Training Timeline
*   **1 day per mile rule:** 26 days minimum before normal training
*   **Realistic:** 4-6 weeks to return to full training, 3-4 months before next marathon
