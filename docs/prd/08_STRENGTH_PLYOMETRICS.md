# PRD: Strength Training & Plyometrics

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the strength training and plyometric protocols integrated into marathon training. Research shows combined heavy resistance and plyometric training produces **4-8% running economy improvements** and up to **51% reduction in hamstring injuries**.

## 2. Research Foundation
*   **Nordic Hamstring Curls:** 51% injury reduction (meta-analysis of 8,459 athletes)
*   **Heavy Resistance Training:** 85-95% 1RM produces strongest running economy benefits (effect size -0.31)
*   **Plyometrics:** 6 weeks of 5 min/day hopping improved economy by 4-7%
*   **Combined Training:** Heavy resistance + plyometrics yields superior results (effect size -0.426) to either alone
*   **Interference Effects:** Males experience greater interference (effect size -0.43) than females; minimize by strategic scheduling

## 3. Core Exercise Categories

### 3.1. Injury Prevention Exercises

#### Nordic Hamstring Curls (Highest Evidence)
*   **Benefit:** 51% hamstring injury reduction
*   **Progression:**
    *   Weeks 1-5: 1 set × 5 reps, 2×/week
    *   Weeks 5-10: 2-3 sets × 6-10 reps, 2×/week
    *   Maintenance: 1 set × 5-6 reps, 1×/week (preserves protective benefits)
*   **Form:** Partner or anchor feet, slowly lower torso forward under control, catching with hands before face hits ground

#### Single-Leg Exercises
*   **Single-Leg Squats/Pistol Squats:** 3-4 sets × 5-10 reps each leg (quadriceps, hip stabilizers, knee health)
*   **Bulgarian Split Squats:** 3 sets × 8-12 reps per leg (85% load on front leg vs. 75% for regular split squats)
*   **Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts:** 3 sets × 8-10 reps per leg (posterior chain, stability)

### 3.2. Running Economy Exercises

#### Heavy Resistance (85-95% 1RM)
*   **Back Squats:** 4 sets × 3-5 reps at 85-95% 1RM
*   **Deadlifts:** 3-4 sets × 3-5 reps at 85-95% 1RM
*   **Leg Press:** 3 sets × 4-6 reps at 85-90% 1RM
*   **Romanian Deadlifts:** 3 sets × 6-8 reps at 70-80% 1RM

**Mechanisms:**
*   Neuromuscular adaptations (not muscle growth)
*   Improved force production capability
*   Requires 10-14 weeks for significant effects (better than 6-8 week programs)

#### Plyometric Training
*   **Drop Jumps:** 3 sets × 5-8 reps from 30-60cm boxes
*   **Countermovement Jumps:** 3 sets × 6-10 reps
*   **Bounding:** 3 sets × 30-40m for distance

*   **Box Jumps:** 3 sets × 6-8 reps

**Volume:**
*   Progressive: 120-200 jumps per session
*   Frequency: 2-3×/week
*   Duration: 8-10 weeks for optimal adaptation

#### Isometric Training
*   **Isometric Squats:** 3-4 sets × 30-45 seconds at 90° knee angle
*   **Isometric Leg Press:** 3 sets × 30 seconds at 70-80% 1RM
*   **Benefits:** 4-7% running economy improvement through increased tendon stiffness, lower impact during high training load periods

### 3.3. Plyometric Hopping Protocol (Highest ROI)
Research-backed 6-week protocol: 5 minutes daily improves economy by 4-7%

*   **Week 1:** 12 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 15 seconds rest
*   **Week 2:** 16 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 12 seconds rest
*   **Week 3:** 20 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 10 seconds rest
*   **Week 4:** 24 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 7 seconds rest
*   **Week 5:** 26 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 6 seconds rest
*   **Week 6:** 28 sets × 10 seconds hopping, 5 seconds rest

**Form:** Hop as high as possible, minimize ground contact time, knees extended throughout

**Mechanism:** Increases Achilles tendon stiffness by 16%, reducing oxygen consumption by 4%

## 4. Periodization Across Training Phases

### 4.1. Base Phase (8-12 weeks)
**Optimal window for strength volume** (moderate running volume allows recovery)

*   **Frequency:** 2-3 sessions/week
*   **Intensity:** 60-75% 1RM
*   **Volume:** 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps
*   **Focus:** Anatomical adaptation, movement pattern establishment
*   **Exercises:** All major patterns (squats, deadlifts, lunges, Nordic curls, single-leg work, hip strengthening, core)

**Example Week:**
*   Monday: Easy run + full-body strength (60 min total)
*   Tuesday: Easy run
*   Wednesday: Moderate run
*   Thursday: Easy run + lower-emphasis strength (45 min total)
*   Friday: Easy run
*   Saturday: Long run
*   Sunday: Rest or easy recovery

### 4.2. Build Phase (6-8 weeks)
**Transition to maximal strength** (running volume/intensity increasing)

*   **Frequency:** 2 sessions/week
*   **Intensity:** 80-90% 1RM
*   **Volume:** 3-5 sets × 4-6 reps
*   **Addition:** Introduce plyometrics 1×/week
*   **Timing:** After easy runs OR separated by 6+ hours from quality running

**Focus:** Maintain strength established in base, begin power development

### 4.3. Peak Phase (6-8 weeks)
**Maintain strength, develop power** (running takes priority)

*   **Frequency:** 1-2 sessions/week
*   **Intensity:** 70-85% 1RM lifted with explosive intent
*   **Volume:** 2-3 sets × 4-6 reps
*   **Plyometrics:** Reactive plyometrics maintained
*   **Priority:** If recovery compromised, skip strength rather than sacrifice long runs

### 4.4. Taper Phase (2-3 weeks)
**Minimal strength, maximize freshness**

*   **Frequency:** Maximum 1 light session/week during weeks 1-2, ZERO the final week
*   **Intensity:** 70-80% 1RM
*   **Volume:** 2 sets × 3-5 reps
*   **Focus:** Neural activation without fatigue
*   **Final Week:** No strength training at all before marathon

## 5. Minimizing Interference Effects

### 5.1. Strategic Scheduling
*   **Base/Build Phases:** Strength before running OR separate by 6+ hours when doing both same day
*   **Peak/Taper:** Strength after running OR completely different days
*   **Never:** Heavy squats/deadlifts day before long runs or hard workouts
*   **Minimum:** 48 hours between heavy lower-body strength sessions

### 5.2. Recovery Windows
*   **24 hours:** Reduced running economy and muscle activation
*   **48 hours:** Most acute interference effects dissipate
*   **Weekly Structure:** Alternate hard days across modalities
    *   Monday hard strength → Tuesday easy running
    *   Tuesday hard running → No hard strength until Thursday

### 5.3. Frequency Limitations
*   **Peak Volume Periods:** Reduce to 1×/week if necessary
*   **Maximum During Peak:** 2 sessions/week for most runners
*   **Maintenance:** Even infrequent strength (1×/week) preserves neuromuscular qualities

### 5.4. Nutrition Timing
*   **Immediate Post-Strength:** 20-30g protein + 30-50g carbohydrates within 30 minutes
*   **Before Running (if same day):** Consume recovery nutrition between sessions
*   **Purpose:** Supports recovery, minimizes interference between training modes

## 6. Progression Protocols

### 6.1. Load Progression (Weeks 1-12)
*   **Week 1:** Start at 60% estimated 1RM, assess form
*   **Weeks 2-4:** Add 2.5-5kg per session for lower body, 1-2.5kg for upper body
*   **Weeks 5-8:** Progress to 75-80% 1RM
*   **Weeks 9-12:** Reach 85-90% 1RM for maximal strength phase
*   **Test 1RM:** Only if experienced with lifting; otherwise estimate from 5RM

### 6.2. Plyometric Progression
*   **Weeks 1-2:** 40-60 contacts/session (beginner)
*   **Weeks 3-6:** 60-80 contacts/session (intermediate)
*   **Weeks 7+:** 80-100 contacts/session (advanced)
*   **Frequency:** 1-2×/week with minimum 72 hours between sessions
*   **Quality Over Quantity:** Stop when form deteriorates

### 6.3. Deload Protocol
*   **Every 4 Weeks:** Reduce load to 70% 1RM, maintain volume
*   **Coincide With:** Running recovery weeks when possible
*   **Purpose:** Allow tissue repair, prevent overuse injuries

## 7. Form & Safety

### 7.1. Movement Quality Standards
*   **Depth:** Squats to parallel (thigh parallel to ground) minimum
*   **Back Position:** Neutral spine maintained throughout all lifts
*   **Knee Tracking:** Over middle toe, no valgus collapse
*   **Control:** 2-3 second eccentric (lowering), explosive concentric (lifting)

### 7.2. When to Skip Strength Training
*   Acute injury affecting movement patterns
*   Excessive soreness from previous session (>7/10)
*   Within 48 hours of marathon-specific workout (long run, race-pace run)
*   Final week before goal race

### 7.3. Coaching & Instruction
*   **First-Time Lifters:** Require form instruction (videos, in-person coaching, or detailed app guidance)
*   **Movement Screening:** Identify mobility limitations (ankle dorsiflexion, hip flexion) before heavy loading
*   **Regressions:** Provide bodyweight alternatives for all exercises (goblet squats, step-ups, etc.)

## 8. Integration with Running Training

### 8.1. Load Accounting
*   Strength sessions contribute to overall training load via Session RPE × Duration
*   Heavy sessions: typically 7-8 RPE × 45-60 minutes = 315-480 load units
*   Include in ACWR calculations (see [07_LOAD_MANAGEMENT.md](./07_LOAD_MANAGEMENT.md))

### 8.2. Adaptive Adjustments
*   If ACWR exceeds 1.5, reduce both running AND strength volume
*   Traffic light system applies: Red light = skip strength, prioritize recovery
*   Performance indicators: Track squat/deadlift progress as fitness proxy

### 8.3. Injury Prevention Priorities
*   Nordic curls maintained even when other strength reduced (minimal fatigue, maximal protection)
*   Hip strengthening continues through all phases (low fatigue cost, high injury prevention benefit)
*   Heavy compound lifts first to be reduced during peak running volume

## 9. User Experience

### 9.1. Exercise Library
*   Video demonstrations for all exercises (front view, side view, common mistakes)
*   Progressive tutorials: bodyweight → light load → heavy load
*   Form cues and safety tips
*   Equipment alternatives (barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, bodyweight)

### 9.2. Workout Structure
*   Pre-built sessions for each phase
*   Customizable based on available equipment
*   Rest timer between sets
*   Load tracking (weight used, reps completed, perceived difficulty)

### 9.3. Progress Tracking
*   Estimated 1RM calculations
*   Volume load trends (sets × reps × weight)
*   Running economy correlation (does strength progress coincide with improved HR-pace relationship?)

## 10. Success Metrics
*   **Adherence:** ≥85% completion of prescribed strength sessions
*   **Injury Reduction:** Track hamstring, knee, hip injury rates (target: <50% of baseline after Nordic curl integration)
*   **Running Economy:** 4-8% improvement in HR-pace relationship over 12-16 weeks when strength consistently performed
*   **Strength Gains:** Lower body compounds progress 20-40% in 12-week base phase
